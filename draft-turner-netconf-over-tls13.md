# Introduction

{{!RFC7589}} defines how to protect NETCONF messages {{!RFC6241}} with
TLS 1.2 {{?RFC5246}}. This document describes defines how to protect
NETCONF messages with TLS 1.3 {{!I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis}}.

This document addresses cipher suites and the use of early data, which is also
known as 0-RTT data. It also updates the "netconf-tls" IANA Registered Port
Number entry to refer to this document. All other provisions set forth
in {{RFC7589}} are unchanged, including connection initiation, message framing,
connection closure, certificate validation, server identity, and client
identity.


# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Early Data

Early data (aka 0-RTT data) is a mechanism defined in TLS 1.3
{{I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis}} that allows a client to send data ("early data")
as part of the first flight of messages to a server. Early data is
permitted by TLS 1.3 when the client and server share a PSK, either obtained
externally or via a previous handshake. The client uses the PSK to
authenticate the server and to encrypt the early data.

As noted in {{Section 2.3 of I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis}}, the security
properties for early data are weaker than those for subsequent TLS-protected
data. In particular, early data is not forward secret, and there are no
protection against the replay of early data between connections.
{{Appendix E.5 of I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis}} requires applicaitons not
use early data without a profile that defines its use. This document
specifies that implementations MUST NOT use early data.

# Cipher Suites

Implementations MUST support TLS 1.3 {{I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis}}, and
implementation are REQUIRED to support the mandatory-to-implement cipher
suites listed in {{Section 9.1 of I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis}}.

Implementations MAY implement additional TLS cipher suites that provide
mutual authentication and confidentiality, which are required for NETCONF
{{RFC6241}}.

Implementations SHOULD follow the recommendations given in
{{!I-D.ietf-uta-rfc7525bis}}.

~~~
So, this is what {{Section 9.1 of I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis}} says:

  A TLS-compliant application MUST implement the TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
  [GCM] cipher suite and SHOULD implement the TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
  [GCM] and TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 [RFC8439] cipher suites (see
  Appendix B.4).

  A TLS-compliant application MUST support digital signatures with
  rsa_pkcs1_sha256 (for certificates), rsa_pss_rsae_sha256 (for
  CertificateVerify and certificates), and ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256.  A
  TLS-compliant application MUST support key exchange with secp256r1
  (NIST P-256) and SHOULD support key exchange with X25519 [RFC7748].

Is there any reason to narrow the algorithm choices?

My guess is not.  These ought to be available in all TLS libraries.

# Security Considerations

Please review the Security Considerations in TLS 1.3 {{I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis}}.

Please review the recommendations regarding Diffie-Hellman exponent reuse
in {{Section 7.4 of I-D.ietf-uta-rfc7525bis}}.

Please review the Security Considerations in NETCONF {{!RFC6241}}.

NETCONF is used to access configuration and state information and to
modify configuration information. TLS 1.3 mutual authentication is used
to ensure that only authorized users and systems are able to view the
NETCONF server's configuration and state or to modify the NETCONF
server's configuration. To this end, neither the client nor the server
should establish a NETCONF over TLS 1.3 connection with an unknown,
unexpected, or incorrect peer identity; see {{Section 7 of RFC7589}}. If
deployments make use of this list of Certification Authority (CA)
certificates {{!RFC5280}}, then the listed CAs should only issue certificates
to parties that are authorized to access the NETCONF servers. Doing otherwise
will allow certificates that were issued for other purposes to be
inappropriately accepted by a NETCONF server.

Please review {{?RFC6125}} for further details on generic host name
validation in the TLS context.

Please review the recommendations regarding certificate revocation checking
in {{Section 7.5 of I-D.ietf-uta-rfc7525bis}}.

{{!RFC5539}} assumes that the end-of-message (EOM) sequence, ]]>]]>,
cannot appear in any well-formed XML document, which turned out to be
mistaken. The EOM sequence can cause operational problems and open
space for attacks if sent deliberately in NETCONF messages. While it is
possible, the likelihood is believed to be very low.  The EOM sequence is
used for the initial \<hello\> message to avoid incompatibility with existing
implementations.  When the client and server both implement the :base:1.1
capability, a proper framing protocol (see {{Section 3 of RFC7589}}) is used
for the rest of the NETCONF session, to avoid injection attacks.


# IANA Considerations

IANA is requested to add a reference to this document in the
"netconf-tls" entry in the "Registered Port Numbers". The updated
registry entry would appear as follows:

     Transport Protocol(s):  TCP
     Assignee:               IESG <iesg@ietf.org>
